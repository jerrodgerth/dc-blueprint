## Introduction

As the networking industry enters the NetOps era, network automation is no longer a nice to have but rather a core requirement.
Features like ZTP, continuous monitoring, intent validation and operational changes (**is this new?**) are all now considered tablestakes.
The need for network automation has outpaced the capabilities of available networking operating systems and their respective tooling.
This has created the need for a slew of network automation tools/frameworks which aim at filling the gaps between the requirements of network operators and the available tools.
Nokiaâ€™s datacenter portfolio is uniquely positioned to provide best in class tooling, beginning a new, fully modernized network operating system developed with automation at the center of the architecture.

This section of the datacenter blueprint will cover several of the key topics for management and automation of the network:

* [Zero Touch Provisioning](mgmt-ztp.md)
* [CLI](mgmt-cli.md)
* [gNMI](mgmt-gnmi.md)
* [Telemetry](mgmt-streaming.md)
* [Logging](mgmt-logging.md)
