# Fabric Management

## Summary

Fabric Management is an important part of ongoing data center fabric operations.
It is key that the chosen NOS allow operators maximum flexibility to use automation and operational toolsets of their choice.
SR Linux is the only fully modern NOS that is completely model-driven and therefore provides unprecedented opportunity for integration to other systems.
This is demonstrated by the consistency of control whether using on-box interfaces like CLI  or off-box interfaces such as gNMI.
