As the networking industry enters the NetOps era, network automation is no longer a nice to have but rather a day 0 requirement, it has become tables stakes from ZTP to continued monitoring, intent validation and operational changes.
Nokiaâ€™s datacenter portfolio is uniquely positioned to provide best in class tooling and a network operating system developed with network automation at the for front of its architecture.
The need for network automation has outpaced the capabilities of available networking operating systems and their respective tooling.
This has created the need for a slew of network automation tools/frameworks which aim at filling the gaps between the requirements of network operators and the available tools.
Broadly, automation needs fall into the following category:

* Zero Touch Provisioning
* Configuration generation and management
* Interfaces to provision and monitor network devices
