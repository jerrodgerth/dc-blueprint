# Fabric Routing

## Introduction

Moving from switching/bridging to routing is a key change when implementing a Clos-based network fabric as described in the previous section.
By design, a Clos fabric provides many links between different stages of the network.
Routing protocols are designed to use many paths while maintaining a resilient, loop-free network.
This section will review considerations for selecting a fabric routing protocol and why Nokia recommends using BGP.
